                                daily life routine. Steve jobs which is no doubt one of the most interesting individuals in the world 
                                in the past 50 years, has shaped Apple, it’s products & services, driving Apple to a market 
                                revolutionary and leader.</br>
                                One of the most important pieces of information one should know about investing in a stock is (1) the 
                                people behind this operation and the value estimated in the markets, (2) the ability of a traded company 
                                to remain stable and the ability to re-invent itself and the offerings it has to its customer.

                                        more in its products life circle, managed to rise like a phoenix and dominate the mobile market 
                                        by being able to predict an entire world which never existed before and turn it in to reality, 
                                        a reality which is available for anyone out there.</br>

                                        The truth is how can one build and create this ability to predict or to locate such 
                                        investment opportunity as a small time investor with limited access to such information? 
                                        How can we all predict that APPLE stocks will show a growth of 57% in just 5 months?

                                        The answer is more simple than you may think… DON’T THINK… ACT! We are all familiar with the 
                                        names of the big brands like APPLE, AMAZON and more, since they touch our daily life, so we are 
                                        more likely to understand what they do and how does it effect us all. So take action, open a 
                                        Watch List account with a broker or a financial institute before you make a decision of which 
                                        stock should you buy, follow it, receive simplified notifications to your phone and Email and
