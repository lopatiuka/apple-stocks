                            <p class = "about-intro">In 1976 when Apple Inc was established little did we know how much it would 
                                become a part of our daily lives. Steve Jobs, which in no doubt, was one of the most interesting 
                                individuals in the world revolutionized the world of personal technology. Apple's products & services 
                                disrupted mainstream industries like personal computing and mobile phones and forever changed the way 
                                we interact with technology.</br>
                            </br>
                                Two of the most important pieces of information one should know about investing in a technology stock 
                                like Apple are the people behind behind the brand itself and the company's ability to re-invent 
                                itself in a way that adds value to its brand, its products, its customers and the markets that it 
                                operates.
                            </p>

                                <div class = "paragraphs">
                                    <p class = "history-paragraph">In our case, Apple which covers a full array of technology products;
                                        managed to rise like a phoenix and dominate the mobile market by being able to predict an 
                                        entire world which never existed before and turn it in to reality. This was the world of 
                                        smartphones and smart devices. Products that we are all blessed to be enjoying today!</br>
                                    </br>
                                        The truth is how can one build and create this ability to predict or to locate such 
                                        investment opportunity as a small time investor with limited access to such information? How 
                                        can we all predict that Apple stocks will show a growth of 57% in just 5 months? Mind you, 
                                        this growth number is being witnessed in 2020; a pandemic year that has shaken world economies. 
                                        So to achieve such success within this time is simply admirable.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class = "history-paragraph">Not forgetting the fact that this is happening in the year of the 
                                        Corona Virus?</br>
                                    </br>
                                        So how does a regular person predict such growth? The answer is simple. DON’T THINK… ACT! 
                                        We are all familiar with the names of the big brands like APPLE, AMAZON and more, since they 
                                        are part of our daily life. As such, we are more likely to understand what they do and how 
                                        their work affects us all. So take action, open a Watch List account with a broker or a 
                                        financial institution. Then, before you make a move and buy a stock, follow it, see its 
                                        progress. How can you do that? Very easy, Just set up your stock notifications to your phone 
                                        and Email, observe the stock trends and then start your venture and invest!
